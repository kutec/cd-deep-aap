@kutec:
* worked at architecture level: decided to go with feature-vise, instead of seperate folder for components, modules, etc.
* created LeavesModule: defined routes, and make it lazily loaded
* created seperate folder "libs" for external libraries like Material, Bootstrap, etc. - "libs/libs.index.ts"
* created routing module
* created shared module for shared sections like header, footer, etc.
* coordinated with team on the design part. By Monday we will be finalizing the design mostly for Leaves dashboard page
